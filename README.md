I am a CS undergraduated and developer. I am learning with interest in various fields, including

  - Web development (`Node.js`, `Spring`, `K8S`, `React`)
  - Embedded systems (`ARM`-`STM32Fxx`)
  - 3D graphics (`WebGL`)
  - Artificial Intelligence (`PyTorch`, `Reinforcement Learning`, `Diffusion`)

and so on. I always like to challenge new things.
